1.  Original Message

   I am a secondary school student from Shanghai, China.  This email
   discusses the problems I discovered in the Chinese educational
   system, in terms of students' right to freedom in computing and
   options to control the COVID-19 pandemic from the standpoint of a
   person living in China.

   When COVID-19 broke out in 2020, students were required to watch
   lecture videos produced by the city's education department for twenty
   minutes, then join the Tencent Meetings room to discuss in their own
   class for 10--15 minutes.

   Watching the videos wasn't an issue for me.  Our apartment has cable
   TV, where the videos are broadcast; there was also a website that
   played the livestream without JavaScript.  However, Tencent Meetings
   presented a problem to me.

   At the time, I run Arch Linux.  (Currently, I run Hyperbola GNU/
   Linux-libre, a Free Software-only distribution, which would have made
   this even harder.)  Tencnet Meetings, claiming to support "all
   operating systems and platforms", only supports Windows and macOS.
   (I wonder how they passed the resolution to display that statement, I
   believe that they have many programmers who use GNU/Linux.)  (As of
   October 2021, a classmate noted that there is a "Linux versuon".)
   School required Tencent Meetings, therefore I went through a hard
   proccess to setup QEMU running a Windows 7 virtural machine---I
   believed that 7 would be slightly better than 10 in terms of privacy,
   though as always with nonfree software, I can't really know for sure.
   It was slightly unstable, which is an annoyance, for example the
   connection from the Windows audio server to pulseaudio would stop
   working from time to time, but it was acceptable.  Though my setup
   was okay (in the perspective of my school), it left me in a
   psycological crisis about education and freedom.  More on that later.

   Offline classes resumed in May 2020, as most of China has minimal
   cases of COVID-19.  This freed me from using a proprietary non-
   privacy-respecting bloated piece of software in a virtual machine,
   but it did not free me from teachers' requirement to use WeChat
   (think of it as the equiv of WhatsApp in China), Xiaoheiban (A
   proprietary classroom information distribution system), or other
   pieces of nonfree software.

   Similar to the beliefs stated in the GNU Education project, I believe
   that schools and educaion are a means of sharing information and
   knowledge.  I understand that meeting software and lesson management
   software are used as means of distributing knowledge, rather than the
   knowledge being distributed themselves.  However, I believe this
   doesn't lead to the argument that the mandate of proprietary software
   usage is just, for three reasons as below.

   1.  There are always going to be curious students who wonder how the
       trchnology works.  Proprietary software denies them this right.

   2.  The usage of proprietary software when young may implant
       dependence on it in the future.

   3.  Education is a right and a responsility.  Mandating nonfree
       software in education adds unjust responsibilities on students.

   Point 1 and 2 are explained well in the Education section of the GNU
   website, therefore I am not going to focus on them.  Focusing on the
   third point:

   Under laws of almost all countries, citizens have the right to an
   education.  Traditionally, this involves going to school, meeting
   teachers and classmates, listening to classes, taking notes, passing
   exams (I have strong opinions that exam systems ought to change to
   better represent individual talents, but this is out of scope of this
   memo.) and finishing homework.  Students loose a slight bit of their
   time and freedom of movement (as in, it's not easy to move to a house
   100 miles away from school), in exchange for being educated.

   However, with schools requiring the use of nonfree software, in
   effect students are required to give up their privacy, and digital
   freedom, both crucial rights in modern society, as the effect of
   needing to use nonfree software.  The right to education has
   effectively turned into an exchange for other basic rights.  This is
   not acceptable.

   Furthermore, in countries like China, 9 years of education is
   mandatory for children.  I understand this law as a means to the goal
   of creating a knowledgeble and educated society, which is good.
   However, when mandatory edication mandates nonfree software, it
   deduces to "children are required to use nonfree software".  So,
   being a child here is pretty unlucky, because there goes your right
   to privacy, your independence, and your freedom, because of a law
   that's supposed to help society.

   We need to stop using nonfree software in education.

   In th beginning of this email, I mentioned COVID-19.  You might be
   wondering how China fully put the pandemic under control in just 5
   months, which is seemingly impossible if all you know is how the US
   dealt with this situation.

   The answer is that China is implementing strict contact tracing.
   This is extremely easy because of the prevaliance of survillance.
   Many would argue that this is a benefit of survillance, which I
   believe to be true.  However, no comparisons were given between
   losing privacy and increasing the risk or infection.  Briefly
   inspecting this idea in my head, it's really hard to think about---
   privacy and freedom is important in the long term, at the cost of
   many lives in the pandemic.  The lives of these dead are gone---they
   lose not only privacy and computing freedom, they lose their lives,
   which costs them their oppurtunity to persue their dreams in this
   world, and they have no freedom of choice, speech, etc as they aren't
   alive.  Once again, this is hard to wrap my mind around, therefore I
   would especially like to invite the community to discuss this.

   The contact tracing system used is not Free Software.  At first I
   didn't understand why (except for the explanation that they want to
   profit from harming citizens), but I noticed that the authenticity
   and accuracy of the system may be affected if users are allowed to
   modify their software.  This seems to be the core of some problems
   with regards to software freedom---here, the user is not running
   software to complete their tasks.  Rather, it's the government's way
   to maintain public safety, therefore I believe that whether users
   should be able to modify software in these conditions is up to
   discussion.  Back to the point, since a green-code proof from the
   system is needed to get in a lot of places, a person basically needs
   to use proprietary software to live a normal life (to get into coffee
   shops, for example).

   In America and other countries, things aren't that good either.  For
   one the pandemic isn't controlled well.  As a consequence, a lot of
   places require negative COVID tests to do stuff.  A thread on the
   LibrePlanet mailing list discusses this issue, as a lot of these
   tests require nonfree software on users' phones.  Note that this
   thread spans several months long, as it is a hot discussion, so look
   in the september and october archives too.  The thread explains the
   implications clearly, thus I am not discussing it here.

   (https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libreplanet-discuss/2021-08/
   msg00008.html. (https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libreplanet-
   discuss/2021-08/msg00008.html.))

   Additionally, I heard that some US courts require ZOOM for online
   cases, therefore it seems that a person' right to judicial justice
   comes at the cost of digital freedom.  I can't confirm this, but if
   that's true, I'm truely disappointed at the judicial system, even
   though I'm not a US citizen.

   I am looking foward to a freer society, or at least one where the
   above problems get solved.

2.  Reply from jahoti

   Thank you for your very interesting and insightful piece on the
   topic!  It's nice to hear the personal perspective of someone inside
   China too, being the unfortunate rarity it is.

   You're unfortunately not alone in this; the way educational
   institutions (and no doubt corporations) the world over made such
   sudden changes, even if it was understandable, is doubly traumatic
   for those of us whose perspectives were never considered.  The only
   option I could come up with for my classes was to not go- and I took
   a whole year off just trying to reverse engineer the necessary
   software!

   I completely agree- the fact that non-free software is required to
   meet legal obligations, let alone standard expectations, is
   completely unacceptable!

   However, speaking more broadly, using software in education is itself
   up for debate.  That's not to say computers should be banned from
   classrooms or that schools shouldn't teach computing skills; rather,
   some uses seem to be less about genuine evidence of educational value
   and more about schools' (or governments', or technology companies')
   lust for novelty.  Some prudence might improve education, save money,
   and make using free software a more viable option for students (and
   even teachers).

   For that matter (as a slightly off-topic personal grievance), using
   software well would be a huge improvement.  Digital signatures have
   been around for more than 20 years, yet they have still not made it
   into mainstream use, and in fact some websites implement support for
   _written signatures_!

   Indeed, any weighting of freedom against death is going to be a
   deeply uneasy one.

   For what it's worth, I would eschew a simple dichotomy to introduce a
   third option: providing tools and encouraging citizens to log
   location data for themselves, which then helps them help contact
   tracers.  In countries where authorities are trusted and can easily
   reach their citizens, this seems like a very fair balance; civil
   liberties are respected without significantly hampering disease
   control efforts.

   Of course, if distrust is widespread or mass media are ineffective,
   this doesn't work, and in that case I'd argue limited surveillance
   requirements would be warranted.  The key word, however, if limited:
   under absolutely no circumstances must even a single data entry be
   available to the police, or marketers, or the venue a person entered,
   or anyone except contact tracers working with the individual whose
   record it is if they are confirmed to be infected.  It must also not
   include any data except that which can reliably be used to
   significantly improve tracing efforts- simply the fact that something
   could be mildly useful is not, in my opinion, an excuse for capturing
   it and putting it in a database.  Of course, it must also be deleted
   once it is no longer potentially useful.

   It's worth noting the irony that those areas were violating civil
   liberties would be least acceptable are also the kind that would have
   been more willing to do so.

   This is indeed a double injustice- as well as proprietary software,
   constant possession of a digital device (probably a tracking one) is
   made a prerequisite for many common activities as well.

   In relation to the right to modify contact tracing software, there is
   definitely a discussion to be had!  Personally I see no reason to
   restrict that right; relying heavily on the validity of the data such
   systems produce seems doomed to fail for other reasons anyway, and
   fabricating a plausible dataset is far harder than just "forgetting
   your phone at home".

   Definitely- let us hope that these measures die with the emergency
   they were a response to, and the others can be fought off
   successfully.
