1.  Introduction

   Writing or speaking English, we once faced a conundrum when we were
   taught to refer to a person as male without knowing their gender.  It
   was a ludicrous convention of writing, introduced at a time when
   women were considered as slaves.  Later, we retroactively included
   women as an afterthought in our speech, making reference to *he or
   she*, as though gender even matters for the majority of human
   endeavours; it does not!

   When speaking or writing in English, we are rather fortunate.  A
   historical quirk of our language has gifted us with the linguistic
   ability to respect each other equally.  I refer, of course, to the
   gender-neutral *Singular They* pronouns *they/them*[THEY].

   A historically oppressed, suppressed demographic of people have
   asserted their right to exist[UNBRS], *a right that I support, for I
   am one of them*. My legal ID says that I am a woman, because no legal

   recognition exists for non-binary people in my country.  In private I
   am simply *Leah Rowe*. I identity with aspects of the female gender,
   mentally, but I don't quite fit in.  I realized this, after having
   initially come out as a *trans woman* several years ago.  The only
   thing I know, with absolute certainty, is that I'm *not a man*.

   We do not yet have a *third gender* concept widely used in English-
   speaking countries, but we do have an understanding of what is
   referred to as the gender binary[GDRBIN].  The gender binary is a
   form of propoganda that tells us from birth: only men and women
   exist.  This message is false, and a lie.  In truth, gender is a
   spectrum[GDRID] of diverse identities and expressions, irrespective
   of one's anatomy[SEX].

2.  Pronouns

   Nowadays, many non-binary people will personally use they/them
   pronouns.  It is imperative that such people be fully honoured.  When
   such a person asks you to refer to them using they/them pronouns, you
   MUST comply with this request.  Calling them by any other pronoun is
   wrong, and a grave insult.

   In the English language, we have historically adopted one of the
   following paradigms, when writing about unknown individuals:

   *  Always say *he*. This is seen in many historical texts.  We see it
      today as inherently sexist, but it was the norm at a time when
      women were the literal property of men.
   *  Always say *she*. This is a cringeworthy practise, and only
      legitimizes the very same pervasive form of sexism that sees women
      as *separate* from men.
   *  Always say *he or she*. This is slightly better, but has the same
      problem as always saying *she*, and it only reinforces the gender
      binary.
   *  Always say *he/she*. This is even more annoying than *he or she*.
      It once again reinforces the gender binary.
   *  Alternate between *he* and *she*. It once again reinforces the
      gender binary, in erasure of non-binary people.

   None of the above are ideal.  I suggest one of these:

   *  You SHOULD default to saying *they* or *them*, when referring to a
      person whose gender is unknown.  If an individual specifically
      insists upon *he* or *she*, label them as such.  The person may be
      non-binary, and use they/them pronouns.  Some other pronouns (such
      as xi/xir) are also used, by some people.

   *  In some cases, avoiding all pronouns (even they/them) MAY be
      desirable.  For instance, you may say: the individual, that
      person, this person, the person in question, person of interest,
      etc.

   The above can also apply to speech.  If you meet a new person, you
   SHOULD ask them their pronouns!  This practise should become
   normalized, as opposed to what most people currently do, which is to
   judge a person's appearance and assume male or female gender, based
   on *primary sex characteristics* (a concept which is somewhat flawed
   and inadequate, due to the well-documented existence of intersex
   people[ITSX]

   You will note that I've used Singular They, throughout this memo,
   when referring to an unknown person.  I do this in almost all of my
   articles, and I do it in my speech.  I do it in my thought.  As you
   can see, it is perfectly natural and easy.

   What I'm asking is not controversial, but there are certain types of
   people who will see what I'm writing as an *attack* on their right to
   free expression.  On the contrary, I am simply advocating for the
   rights of those people whose existence has historically been
   suppressed.  Which is to say: I'm advocating for more rights. *Equal*
   rights.  The right to exist.  This right is eroded when your
   existence is routinely questioned, and ignored, by everyone around
   you including friends, family, your school, your job... *this* is
   what I mean when I say *erasure*.

   Imagine that a man is referred to as a woman by his peers.  Would he
   not be insulted?  It's the same thing with a non-binary person, if
   they're being gendered male or female after they specifically
   requested otherwise.

   You may sometimes hear people claim that Singular They is confusing,
   as though referring to a person with *multiple identities*, but this
   is wrongful thinking, and it is insulting.  It is an *erasure*. The
   vast majority of non-binary people are of sound mind, and simply
   expressing themselves in a way that makes them more comfortable.
   This is the same right that everyone should be able to enjoy.

   You may want to learn more about legal recognition of non-binary
   persons around the world[LGRCNB].

   In some cultures, the concept of a *third gender* is well-known, and
   has been for a very long time.[THDGDR]

   Also related, and frequently overlooked, is the intersex[ITSX]
   community.

   The world is a beautiful place, with beautiful people living in it.

   There is a nice video where several non-binary people explain what it
   means (from their own perspectives) to be non-binary.
   (https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=kVe8wpmH_lU)

   *Respect non-binary people.  Trans rights are human rights.*

   This article was written to address transgender issues, which are
   separate from those of sexual orientation.  You can learn more
   generally about LGBTQIA+ people on Wikipedia and many other websites.
   For example:

   ** LGBT (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT) ** Queer
   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer) ** Intersex
   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex) ** Asexuality
   (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality)

   LGBTQIA+ stands for: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer,
   Intersex, Asexual and the plus symbol usually refers to *allies*, who
   are not part of the LGBTQIA community per se, but nonetheless support
   it and try to help us.  I encourage everyone to educate themselves
   about our issues, and our ongoing global struggle for freedom, and
   equality.  We have made some progress, in some parts of the world,
   but it is incomplete, and we are treated very differently (for better
   or worse) depending on what country you look at.

   I live in a country that was historically responsible for suppressing
   LGBTQIA+ rights around the world.  There is an interesting video that
   talks about the role the British Empire played in destroying LGBTQIA+
   rights, in what are now former colonies, many of which still
   routinely oppress LGBTQIA+ people. (https://invidio.us/
   watch?v=DNM_8Yw5Ybw)

   Hatred is inherently illogical.  It is easier and more rewarding to
   simply be nice to others.  We should all do our part to make the
   world a nicer, happier place for all that live in it.
