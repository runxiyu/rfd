Abstract

   The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in a 5-to-4 majority,
   "overturning" the precedent of Roe vs Wade, thus putting the legality
   of abortion into the hand of states.  Many states chose to ban
   abortion.

1.  Background

   In 1973 the Supreme Court of the United States of America ruled
   seven-to-two in favor of Roe's rights to abortion against the state
   of Texas.[RVW] Roe argued for abortion with "privacy", derived from
   the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution.  As the
   U.S. has a precedential judiciary system, this effectively legalizes
   abortion across the country.

   However, as Roe's case was argued for based on privacy rather than
   body autonomy or similar rights, it left a question into if abortion
   is indeed a right that women should have.  After all, if someone is
   accused of murder, the suspect's privacy is not a reason to not
   investigate the case further.  Those against abortion often believe
   that abortion is murder, and thus the privacy argument wouldn't stand
   long.

   In 2022, the Supreme Court overturned this precedent[DVJ], and now
   the abortion rights of women in the united states are in a void.
   This memo focuses on discussing the notion of abortion itself, and
   briefly comments on the decision of the Court.

2.  "Fetus is life, thus abortion is murder."

   Some people believe that because fetus is human life, and abortion is
   nonvoluntary (as in nonvoluntary by the life terminated) termination
   of human life, thus abortion is murder and is unacceptable.

   This reasoning is flawed---nonvoluntary termination of human life,
   even when the decision-maker understands the consequence of their
   action, may or not be murder.

3.  Involuntary termination of life isn't always murder.

   Consider yourself an average person in the United States.  You live
   on paychecks and you're living an average life in a comfortable
   house.  You noticed a poor person, without food, proper clothes, or
   shelter, sleeping in the street, almost frozen to death.  You took
   them home, giving them food, clothes and shelter.  But one day, out
   of whatever reason you decided to stop supporting that person and
   remove them from the house back onto the street.  You understanded
   that they will have a hard time finding foot, shelter and clothes.
   They deceased because of the cold.

   The poor person was life, and your decision did cause their
   decession.  But is this murder?  Man-slaughter?  Any kind of
   statutory offense?  No, not really, it's merely termination of
   voluntary support that you provided for another person.

4.  Non-explicit Contract

   There is a subtle, but eventually significant difference between
   helping a person down the street and voluntary pregnency.
   (Involuntary pregnency is basically "alright, here comes a person at
   your doorstep, you MUST help them and keep them alive", there's not
   much to discuss there in my opinion.)

   In the last example, the ethicalness of terminating support would be
   different if you and the person receiving help signed an explicit
   contract giving you the responsibility to help them but you terminate
   the support when the contract is still valid.

   Indeed, the fetus did not sign a contract with the mother that
   obligates the mother to carry to term.  But similarly, children don't
   sign contracts with their parents to take care of them, but we
   consider parents who don't take care of their children and such to be
   child abuse.  How are they different?

5.  The Difference Between Fetus and Children

   Fetus do not have a proper perception of the world.  Until late terms
   of pregnency fetus are unable to think, while children feel, learn
   and experience the world, building emotions and feelings with others
   and the world around them.

   The value of life depends on its definition.  A scientific definition
   of life which includes bacteria, fungi, parasites, plants, animals
   and many other forms of life doesn't seem inherently valuable to us
   ---almost all of us don't feel bad killing bacteria with an
   ultraviolet lamp, don't feel bad killing plants for consumption, and
   don't feel bad stepping on a mosquito.  Many of us don't feel bad
   consuming animals for food.
