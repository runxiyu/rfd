% Better respect for non-binary people, in defense of human rights

This article concerns the rights and status of transgender people and, more
specifically, non-binary people. A good starting point, if you are
unfamiliar with either topic, would be to read about it on Wikipedia:

* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender>

We can respect non-binary people, and ignore any bigot that says otherwise
==========================================================================

Writing or speaking English, we once faced a conundrum when we were
taught to refer to a person as male without knowing their gender. It was
a ludicrous convention of writing, introduced at a time when women were
considered as slaves. Later, we retroactively included women as an afterthought in
our speech, making reference to *he or she*, as though gender even matters
for the majority of human endeavours; it does not!

When speaking or writing in English, we are rather fortunate. A historical
quirk of our language has gifted us with the linguistic ability to respect
each other equally. I refer, of course, to the gender-neutral *Singular
They* pronouns *they/them*: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they>

[A historically oppressed, suppressed demographic of people](https://transequality.org/issues/resources/understanding-non-binary-people-how-to-be-respectful-and-supportive)
have asserted
their right to exist, *a right that I support, for I am one of them*. My legal
ID says that I am a woman, because no legal recognition exists for non-binary
people in my country. In private I am simply *Leah Rowe*. I identity with aspects
of the female gender, mentally, but I don't quite fit in. I realized this, after
having initially come out as a *trans woman* several years ago. The only thing
I know, with absolute certainty, is that I'm *not a man*.

We do not yet have a *third gender* concept widely used in English-speaking
countries, but we do have an understanding of what is referred to as
the [gender binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary). The gender
binary is a form of propoganda that tells us from birth: only men and women
exist. This message is false, and a lie. In
truth, [gender is a spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity)
of diverse identities and expressions, irrespective of
one's [anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex).

Nowadays, many non-binary people will personally use they/them pronouns. It is
imperative that such people be fully honoured. When such a person asks you
to refer to them using they/them pronouns, you should comply with this request.
Calling them by any other pronoun is wrong, and a grave insult.

In the English language, we have historically adopted one of the following paradigms,
when writing about unknown individuals:

* Always say **he**. This is seen in many historical texts. We see it today as
  inherently sexist, but it was the norm at a time when women were the literal
  property of men.

* Always say **she**. This is a cringeworthy practise, and only legitimizes the
  very same pervasive form of sexism that sees women as *separate* from men.

* Always say **he or she**. This is slightly better, but has the same problem
  as always saying **she**, and it only reinforces the gender binary.

* Always say **he/she**. This is even more annoying than **he or she**.
  It once again reinforces the gender binary.

* Alternate between **he** and **she**. It once again reinforces the gender
  binary, in erasure of non-binary people.

None of the above are ideal. I suggest one of these:

* Default to saying **they** or **them**, when referring to a person whose
  gender is unknown. If an individual specifically insists upon **he**
  or **she**, label them as such. The person may be non-binary, and use
  they/them pronouns. Some other pronouns (such as xi/xir) are also used, by
  some people.

* In some cases, avoiding all pronouns (even they/them) may be desirable.
  For instance, you may say: the individual, that person, this person, the
  person in question, person of interest, etc.

The above can also apply to speech. If you meet a new person, ask them their
pronouns! This practise should become normalized, as opposed to what most
people currently do, which is to judge a person's appearance and assume male
or female gender, based on *primary sex characteristics* (a concept which is
somewhat flawed and inadequate, due to the well-documented existence
of [intersex people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex)).

You will note that I've used Singular They, throughout this article, when
referring to an unknown person. I do this in almost all of my articles, and
I do it in my speech. I do it in my thought. As you can see, it is perfectly
natural and easy.

What I'm asking is not controversial, but there are certain types of people
who will see what I'm writing as an *attack* on their right to free expression.
On the contrary, I am simply advocating for the rights of those people whose
existence has historically been suppressed. Which is to say: I'm advocating
for more rights. *Equal* rights. The right to exist. This right is eroded
when your existence is routinely questioned, and ignored, by everyone around
you including friends, family, your school, your job... *this* is what I
mean when I say *erasure*.

Imagine that a man is referred to as a woman by his peers. Would he not be
insulted? It's the same thing with a non-binary person, if they're being
gendered male or female after they specifically requested otherwise.

You may sometimes hear people claim that Singular They is confusing, as though
referring to a person with *multiple identities*, but this is wrongful thinking,
and it is insulting. It is an *erasure*. The vast majority of non-binary people
are of sound mind, and simply expressing themselves in a way that makes them
more comfortable. This is the same right that everyone should be able to enjoy.

In some cultures, the concept of a *third gender* is well-known, and has been
for a very long time. See:

The world is a beautiful place, with beautiful people living in it.

There is a nice video where several non-binary people explain what it means
(from their own perspectives) to be non-binary. Invidious link:

**Respect non-binary people. Trans rights are human rights.**

This article was written to address transgender issues, which are separate
from those of sexual orientation. You can learn more generally about LGBTQIA+
people on Wikipedia and many other websites. For example:

* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT>
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer>
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex>
* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality>

LGBTQIA+ stands for: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex,
Asexual and the plus symbol usually refers to *allies*, who are not part of
the LGBTQIA community per se, but nonetheless support it and try to help us.
I encourage everyone to educate themselves about our issues, and our ongoing
global struggle for freedom, and equality. We have made some progress, in
some parts of the world, but it is incomplete, and we are treated very
differently (for better or worse) depending on what country you look at.

I live in a country that was historically responsible for suppressing LGBTQIA+
rights around the world. There is an interesting video that talks about the
role the British Empire played in destroying LGBTQIA+ rights, in what are now
former colonies, many of which still routinely oppress LGBTQIA+ people. You can
watch that video here: <https://invidio.us/watch?v=DNM_8Yw5Ybw>

Hatred is inherently illogical. It is easier and more rewarding to simply be
nice to others. We should all do our part to make the world a nicer, happier
place for all that live in it.
