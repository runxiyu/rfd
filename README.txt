Request for Discussions is a series of documents related to Free
Software and free society.

The current RFD Editor is Andrew.

All documents first go through the DRAFT stage.  During this stage,
a directory is created for the document with the "draft-" prefix.  The
author establishes a group of people who discuss and revise the
document if required, and submits it to the RFD Editor and the Libre
Informational Board for review.  Suggestions and revisions are made.
Once a draft becomes a RFD by a supermajority (0.6) in the board, the
RFD editor assigns a RFD number, gives final touches to the style, and
the draft becomes an RFD.

As of now, the Libre Informational Board only has Andrew.  We
desperately need more like-minded people for a more unbiased process.

RFDs are immutable, except for the "Updated By" and "Obsoleted By"
lines in the top left of the document and an "ERRATA EXISTS" message.
Minor problems must be corrected through publishing an ERRATA file and
indicating ERRATA EXISTS in the RFD.  Large changes require new
updating or obsoleting RFDs.

An informational RFDs describing the document series is upcoming.

Currently, IETF RFC tools are used for typesetting.  An experimental
tool is being developed in utilities/, which takes RFD Markup
(documentation pending) input and outputs plain text RFDs.

RFDs stand for Request for Discussions.  Community discussions are very
welcome.  You may submit your ideas to us via the rfd AT andrewyu DOT
org mailing list.  Further discussions with a wider audience, such as in
various IRC channels and mailing lists, are encouraged.
